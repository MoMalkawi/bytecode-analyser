# PatternSearcher: Deobfuscates & Analyzes GamePack

## Overview

**PatternSearcher** is a project that I previously developed but later discontinued. The discontinuation was due to the availability of alternative solutions and a reduction in interest.
What it does is that it finds patterns within the java bytecode to identify fields, methods, and more...
